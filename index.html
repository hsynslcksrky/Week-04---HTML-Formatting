        <dt><span> &#128073; </span>In HTML,for example the <b> &lt; h1 &gt;</b> element is a semetic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role(or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page"</span></dt>
        <dt> &#9658; <mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></dt>
        <dt><span> &#128073; </span>By defaulti most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an  &lt; h1 &gt; with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted). On the other hand,you could make any element look like a top level heading</span></dt>
        <dt> &#9658; <mark>Consider the following</mark></dt>
        <dt> &#8688; this will render it to look like a top level heading but it has no sematic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above.IT is therefre a god idea t use the right HTML element for the right job.</dt>
        <dt> &#8688; HTMl should be coded to represent the data that will be ppulated and based on its default presentation styling. Presenrtation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of css</dt>
